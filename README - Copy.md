READ ME FILE 

As the main file calls all the source file and header files for program excuetion it should exist in one folder to reduce the difficulties 
following  functions are required for the given assesment menu driven program .

OBJECTIVE 1 
CREATION OF : 1 = mylib.h = It is a header file which stores declarations of functions .
              2 = mylib.c = It is source file which has logic of how those functions work or simply the definition of functions .
OBJECTIVE 2  
CREATION OF  1 = arraylib.h = Same it is a header file which stores declartion of functions for array specific operations .
             2 = arraylib.c = It is a source file which have the definition for array specific operations . 

AT FINAL =   main_obj.c  is created which calls the logic of above objectives for program excuetion.


## TO COMPILE AND RUN THE CODE 

if done in cmd type ===> gcc main_obj.c mylib.c arraylib.c -o test.exe 
test.exe
 
OR 
TYPE = gcc main_obj.c mylib.c arraylib.c -o test.exe
Press enter 
type = test.exe 
press enter again 

 Menu of program appears .

if done in vs code = just past the prompt in terminal = 
gcc *.c -o main
.\main
